\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Chem\+File} \\*Chemical system parameters The class that contains the complete information about the primary species. This file contains the list of primary species including the total concentrations for each primary species. The Primary\+Species block requires both the name of the primary species and the total concentration. This section also requires the secondary species block to be populated with at least 1 secondary species. For a kinetic simulation, this requires the Mineral\+Kinetic block to have at least one mineral entry which contains both a mineral name and a mineral surface area }{\pageref{class_chem_file}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Chemical\+State} \\*Data structure for storing the chemical state of the system }{\pageref{struct_chemical_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Database} \\*Data structure for data contained in the chemical database, \textquotesingle{}cdbs.\+yaml\textquotesingle{} This data structure contains all of the chemical information that the user does not need to change. In the database, there is a list of primary species, secondary species, including the equilibrium parameters, and mineral species including the kinetic and equilibrium parameters }{\pageref{class_database}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Equilibrium\+Constants} \\*Data structure containing the constants relating to the equilibrium parameters }{\pageref{struct_equilibrium_constants}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Kinetic\+Constants} \\*Data structure containing the kinetic reaction coefficients }{\pageref{struct_kinetic_constants}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Mineral\+Species} \\*Data structure containing information for a mineral species }{\pageref{struct_mineral_species}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Model\+Inputs} \\*Wrapper for the model inputs Data structure containing the input data to run the simulations. This is a way to interface with both the \doxyref{Chem\+File}{p.}{class_chem_file} and \doxyref{Database}{p.}{class_database} objects to simplify the model interface, as this class contains methods to construct the mass conservation, equilibrium, and kinetic constants }{\pageref{class_model_inputs}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Run\+Options} \\*Wrapper class for the command line options }{\pageref{class_run_options}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Secondary\+Species} \\*The secondary species information struct This data structure contains the information for how to represent a secondary species in terms of primary species }{\pageref{struct_secondary_species}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Total\+Constants} \\*Data structure containing the mass conservation matrix }{\pageref{struct_total_constants}}{}
